# Machine Learning Resources
As I am taking Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course I am taking notes in Jupyter notebooks which are posted here. I believe the programming assignments of the course are somewhat helpful, but will not be great reference material in the future.  

My goals for this class and these notebooks are as follows:  
* Learn how to use machine learning approaches at a low level by using LaTeX to write the math
* Learn how to use the approaches at a practical level by implementing them with my own code
* Verify I understand it by getting an appropriate dataset and applying my implementations
* Learn when to use specific machine learning approaches by noting necessary data types, strengths and weaknesses
